# Hackathon

Merged codebase with:
- Next.js + Supabase app and ingestion/intelligence pipeline
- UI assets/components imported from Lovable

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

- If you see merge conflicts again, resolve files listed by `git status` first.
- Keep `package.json`/`package-lock.json` aligned with the runtime you want to run.
